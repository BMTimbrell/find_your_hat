# Find Your Hat

## About

Find Your Hat is a terminal game where you must move a character, 
avoiding holes, in order to reach the hat.

## Language Used

This game was written in Javascript and uses Node.js. It uses `process.stdin` 
to get user input, and uses `process.argv` so you can enter a width and height for 
the field. I used `Math.random()` to generate a random field.
